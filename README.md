###Troubleshooting Common Issues:

1. Forgotten Password:
Use the password recovery feature if available. This typically requires the email address used during setup.
If recovery options fail, contact the Folder Lock support team for assistance.
2. Locked Out of Files:
Ensure youâ€™re entering the correct password.
Check for software updatesâ€”sometimes bugs in older versions can cause problems.
3. Files Not Accessible After Locking:
Verify if the locked files were moved or tampered with outside the software.
Try reinstalling the software without deleting its configuration to regain access.
4. Backup or Encryption Issues:
Check if there is sufficient storage on the drive or cloud service for backups.
Verify that the encryption module is functioning correctly by testing it on non-critical files.
